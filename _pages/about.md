Hello! I'm Aditya Vikram Choudhary, a [master's student](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/people/aditya-vikram-choudhary/)
(M. Tech in CS) @ IISc, Bangalore since July, 2022. Prior to that I was working with TCS - Research & Innovation as a
fresh grad out of college. I did my B. Tech from IIEST, Shibpur in 2021.

I'm keenly interested in the topics of machine learning, data science, and data structures
& algorithms.

I would love to, in general, connect with other like-minded people too. You can find my contact details below.
